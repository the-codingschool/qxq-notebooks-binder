Here, instead of creating the circuit gate-by-gate, we are going to use functions that are pre-defined to make the circuit for us.

In the fourth part we will dive a little deeper and analyze the algorithm using kets.\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Lab Structure**\n","**Part 1**: [Defining the Size of the Problem](#p1)\n","\n","**Part 2**: [Setting up the Grover Problem](#p2)\n","\n","**Part 3**: [Visualizing the Results of Grover's Algorithm](#p3)\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","### **Learning Objectives**\n","By the end of this lab, you will:\n","* Understand the Grover's search algorithm.\n","* Implement Grover's search from scratch for two qubits.\n","\n","\n","<br>\n","\n","###**Resources**\n","<br>\n","\n","**Before starting, run the code below to import all necessary functions and libraries.**"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YAvvLhRIoqYp"},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import math\n","import scipy\n","try:\n","    import cirq\n","except ImportError:\n","    print(\"installing cirq...\")\n","    !pip install cirq --quiet\n","    import cirq\n","    print(\"installed cirq.\")\n","\n","import random\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","\n","print(\"Libraries Imported Successfully!\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"idga37M2FsMR"},"source":["<a name=\"p1\"></a>\n","\n","---\n","## **Part 1: Defining the size of the problem**\n","---\n","\n","In this part, we will set up the search problem by specifying the number of choices we are searching through, and the choice we are searching for.
